It is, eternally, a work in progress. \r\n\r\nThere is a strong agricultural and food component (AgriCraft, Pam's HarvestCraft, Spice of Life, & Forestry), a rich progression of technology and automation (Immersive Engineering, MagnetiCraft, Progressive Automation, & MineFactory Reloaded), logic and computer programming (OpenComputers, Project Red, & Project Blue), and a touch of magic (Thaumcraft, Twilight Forest & Blood Magic) all in a world where the simple joy of architecture and aesthetics is appreciated (Chisel & Carpenter's Blocks).\r\n\r\nAll feedback is welcome, feel free to post feature requests and suggestions in addition to bug reports on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GiovanniPorta/NationCraft-Pack/issues).",
